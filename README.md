Hello ðŸ‘‹,

Here's where you'll be working. To accomplish your SuperDay task, we've provided a vanilla install of Docusaurus, a prebuilt documentation site. Its authoring and development features are documented here in this repo and on their website.

Consider this your canvas, blank page, or sandbox. The final output, from its contents to its presentation, is entirely yours to create.

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
