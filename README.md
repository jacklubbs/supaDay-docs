Hello ðŸ‘‹,

Here's where you'll be working. To accomplish your SuperDay task, we've provided with you a vanilla install of Docusaurus, a prebuilt documentation site. Its authoring and development features are documented here in this repo and on their [website](https://docusaurus.io/).

Consider this your canvas, blank page, or sandbox. The content and presentation of the final output are entirely up to you.

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
